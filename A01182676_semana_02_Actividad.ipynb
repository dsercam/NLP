The interior is just beautiful.\\nSo they performed.\\nThat\\'s right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.\\n- They never brought a salad we asked for.\\n\"This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.\"\\n\"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.\"\\nThe worst was the salmon sashimi.\\n\"Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.\"\\nThis was like the final blow!\\nI found this place by accident and I could not be happier.\\n\"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.\"\\n\"Overall, I like this place a lot.\"\\nThe only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.\\nAmple portions and good prices.\\n\"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.\"\\nMy first visit to Hiro was a delight!\\nService sucks.\\nThe shrimp tender and moist.\\nThere is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.\\nHard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn\\'t want to eat it for fear of getting sick.\\n\"On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.\"\\n\"Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.\"\\nThe only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.\\nIt\\'s too bad the food is so damn generic.\\n\"The burger is good beef, cooked just right.\"\\nIf you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!\\n\"My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.\"\\nWe ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.\\nHe came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.\\nTheir chow mein is so good!\\n\"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don\\'t enjoy their food.\"\\nThe portion was huge!\\n\"Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.\"\\nThe Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.\\nNot much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.\\n\"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.\"\\n\"The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.\"\\nAt least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.\\nThis place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!\\nThe cocktails are all handmade and delicious.\\nWe\\'d definitely go back here again.\\nWe are so glad we found this place.\\n\"Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.\"\\nAlways a great time at Dos Gringos!\\nUpdate.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing\\nWe got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.\\nA great way to finish a great.\\n\"The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.\"\\n\"- Really, really good rice, all the time.\"\\nThe service was meh.\\n\"It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.\"\\n\"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn\\'t use my common sense.\"\\nThe scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.\\n2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !\\nThe sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.\\nToday is the second time I\\'ve been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.\\nThere is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.\\nComing here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can\\'t wait for the other person to ask to break up.\\nwalked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.\\nThe turkey and roast beef were bland.\\nThis place has it!\\nThe pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.\\nI love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.\\nThe poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.\\nAll I have to say is the food was amazing!!!\\nOmelets are to die for!\\nEverything was fresh and delicious!\\n\"In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.\"\\n\"It\\'s like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you\\'re outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.\"\\n\"Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!\"\\nBest breakfast buffet!!!\\nsay bye bye to your tip lady!\\nWe\\'ll never go again.\\nWill be back again!\\nFood arrived quickly!\\nIt was not good.\\n\"On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.\"\\n\"Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!\"\\n\"The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary\\'s coming.\"\\n\"Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.\"\\n\"I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.\"\\nThis is one of the better buffets that I have been to.\\nSo we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!\\n\"The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!\"\\nThe ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.\\nWill go back next trip out.\\nSooooo good!!\\n\"REAL sushi lovers, let\\'s be honest - Yama is not that good.\"\\n\"At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn\\'t that busy.\"\\nThis is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.\\n\"Nice, spicy and tender.\"\\nGood prices.\\nCheck it out.\\nIt was pretty gross!\\nI\\'ve had better atmosphere.\\nKind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.\\n\"Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.\"\\nI just don\\'t know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.\\n\"Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.\"\\nService was fine and the waitress was friendly.\\n\"The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he\\'s ever eaten.\"\\n\"We thought you\\'d have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.\"\\n\"Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!\"\\nBland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don\\'t want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I\\'ll leave it at that...\\n\"Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.\"\\nI wouldn\\'t return.\\n\"Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I\\'m in Vegas.\"\\nThis place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.\\nPenne vodka excellent!\\n\"They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.\"\\nThe management is rude.\\n\"Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.\"\\n\"Great Subway, in fact it\\'s so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.\"\\nI had a seriously solid breakfast here.\\nThis is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.\\n\"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.\"\\nMy drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.\\nDon\\'t do it!!!!\\nThe waiter wasn\\'t helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.\\nMy husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.\\nAnd the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn\\'t very tasty to me.\\nNice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.\\nThe bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.\\n\"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.\"\\n\"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.\"\\nI give it 2 thumbs down\\nWe watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.\\nMy fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.\\nThis is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.\\nWe waited for forty five minutes in vain.\\nCrostini that came with the salad was stale.\\nSome highlights : Great quality nigiri here!\\nthe staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.\\nthis was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.\\nI ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I\\'d had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.\\nthis place is good.\\n\"Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.\"\\nI came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.\\nI was seated immediately.\\n\"Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.\"\\nAvoid at all cost!\\nRestaurant is always full but never a wait.\\nDELICIOUS!!\\nThis place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.\\nSo don\\'t go there if you are looking for good food...\\nI\\'ve never been treated so bad.\\nBacon is hella salty.\\nWe also ordered the spinach and avocado salad;
